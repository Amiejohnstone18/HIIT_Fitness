# HIIT FITNESS

Upon being provided with the example breifs from Code Institute for the Milestone 1 project, I had decided to design and build a website for a gym. This took my interest as I had recently in January joined a gym due to knowing a personal trainer that works there. Having never previously been interetsed in the gym and what it has to offer, I had started to enjoy the benefits and lifestyle that come with the gym and having a personal trainer. Therefore I wanted to built **HIIT FITNESS** to encourage potenital new customers by attratcing them with a class timetable and the personal trainer specifications, along with keeping existing members satsified that they could find any necessary information via the website. 

# UX 

This project was designed for HIIT Fitness with the purpose to promote themselves online and ensure all necessary information required by existing members and potential new customer is easily accessible via the website.

Main Goals:
* To entice new members via the benefits they can offer upon sign up.
* Introduce the personal trainers and the areas they specialise in.
* Ensure knowledge of the class-for-all gym schedule and how to book a class.
* Provide information on the gyms location/ opening hours/ contact details.
* How to sign up and become a member.

### User Stories 

User A- 
An existing customer looking to find Saturday class times 

User B-
A website user looking to sign up to the gym

User C-
A website user looking to find the gym benefits

### UX design

I had created mockup drawings to start to visualise how the format of the website would function, along with any features I had planned to implement. These can be found in a seperate directory in GitHub to ensure access to view them INPUT MOCK UPS. I also used Adobe InDesign to create visual mock ups of the `<header>` and `<footer>` of the website so I could compare colour schemes. 


### Colour Scheme 

To ensure the site was easy to read and stands out, the colour scheme was limited to:
* `#cc5500`     (burnt orange)
* `#ffffff` 	(white)
* `#a9a9a9`     (medium grey)


# FEATURES

### Existing features

All pages on the website include the same `<navigation>` / `<header>` and `<footer>`. I have used a `:hover` on the navigation menu to ensure the user is aware of the path they are taking.


### `index.html`
