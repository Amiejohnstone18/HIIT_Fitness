# HIIT FITNESS
Upon being provided with the example briefs from Code Institute for the Milestone 1 project, I had decided to design and build a website for a gym. I wanted to build [HIIT FITNESS](https://amiejohnstone18.github.io/HIIT_Fitness/index.html) to encourage potential new customers to join the gym by promoting the unique benefits offered, and in turn, provide all existing members with easy access to any information they may require. The name HIIT FITNESS came from the gym being associated with high-intensity interval training.

From doing initial research on competitor gym websites, I had come across a lot that showed an unnecessary overload of information and ended up being frustrating attempting to navigate myself around the site looking for basic information. From this, I had decided that HIIT FITNESS would be clean in its presentation and ensure there was no confusion on the user's journey from start to finish. 

# UX
**Strategy:**

Due to my website being targeted at a B2C audience, one of my business objectives for this product is to encourage new potential members to join the gym through the promotion of what HIIT FITNESS could offer. As for the wide range of gym competition, it was imperative to ensure the website advertised benefits that would influence a user's decision. This is where I decided that the gym would offer:
* 1 month's free trial
* Refer a friend policy- receive a free personal training session
* Capped memberships- no overcrowding 
* 24/7 gym access
* No lock-in contracts 
* No sign-up fee
* Existing client testimonials

It was also important to consider how to maintain existing customers and ensure their user experience online was enjoyable. I conducted some research and asked my peers what they felt was essential information to be included on a gym website for existing members. It was decided this would be achieved by:
* Providing a class-for-all timetable with an option to download in a PDF
* Information on the personal trainers and their specialties 
* Contact details 

I had also decided that I wanted to include a brief section on how to become a personal trainer for HIIT FITNESS as I felt this would encourage more traffic to the site through a different avenue.

**Scope:**

With a lot of business goals to achieve, I started to determine the website's requirements and key functionality. I wanted the features included to be simple yet effective through the use of:
* User - friendly navigation system 
* Quality website content
* Sign up form
* Sign up button displayed on every page
* Accessible links to social media and the class PDF timetable  

**Structure:**

HIIT FITNESS included a fair amount of textual content, especially for personal trainers and the class timetable. To ensure my information architecture was organised appropriately, I decided to spread out information. In total, HIIT FITNESS has a navigation of five options:
* Home
* Class Timetable
* Personal Trainers
* Sign Up
* Contact Us

I felt this was the best way to ensure I was able to relay all information desired, whilst maintaining a presentable and clean read. I didn't want my users to spend too long on a page overloaded with different information. I wanted to ensure the website was direct in its approach to guarantee the user's journey was simple and to the point, keeping in mind it not taking longer than 3 clicks to get to the desired endpoint.

**Skeleton:**

As mentioned above, the website included 5 navigation points in its menu. I wanted to ensure my benefits, although being properly informed in their section, have links from the home page to information that may not be obvious in the navigation menu. 
For example, on the home page, the three images display links to:

* Free Trial
* Refer a friend 
* Become a Personal Trainer

If I had not displayed these features here, a user may have missed out on the information and therefore the opportunity to get involved. 

I created some [mock-up drawings](design-mockups) of the website and its intended layout and used these to have peers navigate themselves around the site to ensure there were no dead ends and all information was effectively accessible. In addition to this, I asked them to think of scenarios potential website users may have to ensure they can easily find what they are looking for.


**User Stories:**

User A 

*"As an existing member, I want to find out how I book into one of the gym classes so that I can attend."*

User B 

*"I am not a member but I am looking to sign up to the gym, where can I do this?"*

User C

*"I am thinking about becoming a member, but I have no previous gym experience and would like some trainer help"*

**Surface:** 

I knew I was going to be using a lot of visuals for the website, therefore I needed the visual language to be simple yet effective. I created [mock-ups](design-mockups) of the navigation menu `<header>` and the `<footer>` using [Adobe InDesign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_InDesign) and from here did some audience research on the preferred colour scheme. 

The decided colours used in the site are:
* `#FFFFFF` (White)
* `#cc5500` (Orange)
* `#a9a9a9` (Grey)

I had downloaded the animal claw [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) from Font Awesome and from there, using [Adobe Illustrator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Illustrator) added the HIIT FITNESS text and overall logo. The animal claw representing the fast-paced, high- intensity of being a member of HIIT FITNESS.

The decided font for HIIT FITNESS is Open Sans Condensed downloaded from Google Fonts.

# TESTING 

I ensured to validate my code using:

* [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

* [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)


**User Stories**

As previously mentioned in my UX design, I asked peers to create real-life potential user stories so I could evaluate whether my website was serving its purpose. Once I had built HIIT FITNESS, I again tested these user stories to ensure there were no flaws in the narrative of these enquiries. 

User A


*"As an existing member, I want to find out how I book into one of the gym classes so that I can attend."*

* A simple click from the Home page to the Timetable, within the page introduction it states *"To book into one of our classes, simply email your name and the class you want to book to hiit-fitness@gmail.com and you will receive an email confirming your place in the class."* In the case of a user downloading the PDF, this information is also repeated on that document.

User B 

*"I am not a member but I am looking to sign up to the gym, where can I do this?"*

* On every page there is a badge displayed top- left which says *"Sign up for Â£24.99"*, a click of this button will take the user to the sign-up form. In addition to this, the navigation menu displays a *"Sign up"* option containing all relevant information. 

User C

*"I am thinking about becoming a member, but I have no previous gym experience and would like some trainer help"*

* From clicking on the personal trainer option on the navigation menu, it will take a user to a page of 6 employed trainers. With each trainer, we have provided their name and some information about their specialty to ensure a member is getting the best out of their work out goals. 

Due to having a sign-up form on the website, I wanted to ensure this worked and didn't accept fake email addresses. I tested this through:


1. Go to the sing up page.
2. Fill in the form without an '@' in the email address.
3. The form will not accept the text and will ask you to include an '@'.

The form also includes a section for a referrers email, I wanted to be certain that a user could sign up without having to input a referrers email address, had they not had a referrer. I tested this via:
Go to the signup page.

1. Fill in the form correctly, refraining from putting any information in the referrer box.
2. Submit the form.
3. This works correctly. 

I have links to social media in the footer of each page. To ensure these worked, I tested clicking them on every page and got redirected in a separate window to the desired platform. 

The timetable PDF is similar to the above, the link will open a new window with the desired document available to download. 

I repeatedly tested the websites internal links such as:
* Sign up badge 
* Free Trial
* Refer a Friend
* Become a Trainer 

**Responsiveness and Browser compatibility**

I created a Responsive Testing spreadsheet in Excel which for this document I exported into a PDF to view. On here, I logged the outcome of the deployed website on various devices and browsers.
